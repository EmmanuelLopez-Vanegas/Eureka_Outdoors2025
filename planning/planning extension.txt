# How tf are we gonna do UI 
# We need to make it not honour system since we cant trsut that the users will do 




Ideas:
1. Alarm - Notification reminder to go outside every once in a while
- making a timer to make sure that people exersice, do the activties they have to
- ensures people build and keep up good habits, walking around, getting vitamin D, etc.
- goal setting/rewards, as well as streaks 
- 
- 

2. Scavenger hunt type program
- We have a large list of outdoor items
- We pick 3 random items from the list and give them to users to go outside and find
- We use machine learning to verify that the images they submitted are actually what they're supposed to be
- We have a streak system to encourage the users to keep up their daily habit of going outside

3 . bereal  type app 
- make an app that forces the user to a pictre - We have a large list of random outdoor items
- We pick 3 random items fsers to find, daily
- User takes pictures of these items and we use AI to verify that the images they submit are actually what they should be
- We have a streak for each person that finds all of their items
- This encourages t
- Leaderboards (?)a
